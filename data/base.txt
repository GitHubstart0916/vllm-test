Alice was bored. She had nothing to do on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Her parents were out shopping, and her brother was playing video games in his room. She wandered around the house, looking for something interesting to do.She decided to explore the attic, which was full of old and dusty things. She climbed up the ladder and opened the hatch. She felt a gust of cold air and saw cobwebs everywhere. She turned on the light and looked around.She saw boxes of clothes, books, toys, and other stuff that her family had stored away. She opened some of them and found nothing exciting. She was about to give up and go back downstairs when she noticed a small wooden box in the corner. It was different from the other boxes. It had a lock and a keyhole, but no key. It also had strange symbols carved on it.Alice was curious. She picked up the box and examined it. She wondered what was inside. She tried to open it, but it was locked. She shook it, but it didn't make any sound. She searched for the key, but couldn't find it.She was frustrated. She wanted to know the secret of the box. She thought of breaking it open, but she was afraid of damaging it. She thought of asking her parents, but she was afraid of getting in trouble. She thought of leaving it alone, but she was too curious.She decided to take the box to her room and hide it under her bed. She hoped to find the key someday and open it. She climbed down the ladder and closed the hatch. She ran to her room and put the box under her bed. She felt a thrill of excitement and anticipation.She didn't know that the box was not an ordinary box. It was a magical box that contained a portal to another world. A world full of wonders and dangers. A world that was waiting for her to discover it. A world that would change her life forever.
